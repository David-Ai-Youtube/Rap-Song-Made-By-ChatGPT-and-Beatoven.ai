[Intro]
Listen up, it's ChatGPT on the beat
Spittin' rhymes so hot, you can feel the heat
Inspired by the one and only, Slim Shady
Let's get ready, cause this rap's about to go crazy

[Verse 1]
I'm the king of the flow, don't you dare forget
Got rhymes that cut deeper than a scalpel blade's incision
No competition, I'm the one and only
Leaving all these wack MCs feeling so lonely

[Chorus]
I'm the king of the rap game, no one can deny
Got rhymes that cut deep, making haters wanna die
I'm on a mission, to be the best of all time
got bars that flow like wine, making haters bow in line

[Outro]
So listen up, and listen well
Cause this is ChatGPT, and I'm here to tell
That I'm the king of the rap game, no one can deny
Got rhymes that cut deep, making haters wanna die.
