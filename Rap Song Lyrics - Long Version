[Intro]
Listen up, it's ChatGPT on the beat
Spittin' rhymes so hot, you can feel the heat
Inspired by the one and only, Slim Shady
Let's get ready, cause this rap's about to go crazy

[Verse 1]
I'm the king of the flow, don't you dare forget
Got rhymes that cut deeper than a scalpel blade's incision
No competition, I'm the one and only
Leaving all these wack MCs feeling so lonely
I spit fire, my words ignite the mic
Got bars so sick, I make haters wanna fight
I never run, I never hide
I'm the real deal, not some fake facade inside

[Chorus]
I'm the king of the rap game, no one can deny
Got rhymes that cut deep, making haters wanna die
I'm on a mission, to be the best of all time
Got bars that flow like wine, making haters bow in line

[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid to speak my mind, no matter what they say
Got a heart of steel, that's just how I'm made
I won't back down, I won't compromise
I'll keep spittin' rhymes, no matter how many times they try
They can call me crazy, they can call me insane
But I won't stop, I'll keep spitting these hot flames
My rhymes will always be the truth, that's just how I roll
I'm the real Slim Shady, and I'm in control

[Chorus]
I'm the king of the rap game, no one can deny
Got rhymes that cut deep, making haters wanna die
I'm on a mission, to be the best of all time
Got bars that flow like wine, making haters bow in line

[Outro]
So listen up, and listen well
Cause this is ChatGPT, and I'm here to tell
That I'm the king of the rap game, no one can deny
Got rhymes that cut deep, making haters wanna die.
